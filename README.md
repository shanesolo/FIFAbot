# FIFAbot

Credit goes to /u/tonyg623 and /u/INCOMPLETE_USERNAM for pieces of their script that I bastardized because I don't know Python.

This bot is run once per day to create "daily threads" on various topics for /r/FIFA and then stickies an index to those threads to the top of the subreddit that will link back to the daily threads. The bot uses wiki pages for all other text not contained in the script. 

You can PM me on reddit via /u/shane_solo if you need help fitting this to your needs.
